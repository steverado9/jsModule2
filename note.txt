    Module
A module is a chunk of code in an external file that performs a specific task or function.
This helps keep your code short 
The re-useability is high
The code becomes more cleaner
Whenever we talk about Modules, we automatically talk about import and export
    Import and Export
-This helps share things from one module to another module.
-You import and export anything. Be it function, variable etc.
    Types of export and import
1)named import and export: We export using the name of the variable and we also import using the same name.
-if you are exporting multiple things use named export.
2)default import and export: We use the keyword dafult when exporting
-if you want to export one thing from a module, use default export.
-when importing a default value, it is not madetory to use the same name as the export.

    Aliases
This is while importing something from another module, you can rename it to avoid name conflict.
-you can do many aliases as you wish.

    NameSpaces
This is used when you have so many components that you are exporting, you can be naming them and be adding ",".
Instead you use name spaces.
-We use * and a name when importing alot of exports.
-(*) means everything from the export module.

    Combined exports
This is a very important feature when you have multiple modules which are exporting things and you have to import them 
into multiple places, you can combine them into a single module and from there, you will export it once and use it.

    Dynamic imports
-static import and export cannot be conditional and they are always written at the top of your code.
-dynamic import can be used anywhere in the code.
-dybamic import can be wrapped inside a conditional statement.

    promise.all() Method
This is an inbuilt javascript method that can take lots of promises.
